# PDP-11 hack
This project is a (tentative) Kicad schematics of the famous PDP-11 hack. If I am correct, it was a project by Len Bayles to build a minimal PDP-11 around the J-11, a PDP-11 microprocessor, on a breadboard.

Several people have since produced various versions of this PDP-11 hack. Each has some variation, improvement, and/or additional features.
My version is inspired by Brent Hilpert with a few differences, notably, I put buffers on the data bus (not sure my implementation is valid).

Later I probably will take inspiration of the work of Peter Schranz:

Beware the component types are a bit inhomogeneous (mix of TTL LS, ACT, etc...) as I am a Kicad noob!
