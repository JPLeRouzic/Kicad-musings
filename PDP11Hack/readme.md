# PDP-11 hack
This is a folder where are stored various Kicad projects loosely related to PDP-11.

The first project is a (tentative) Kicad schematics the famous PDP-11 hack. It was a project by Len Bayles to build a minimal PDP-11 around the J-11, a PDP-11 microprocessor, on a breadboard.

Several people have since produced various versions of this PDP-11 hack. Each has some additional features.
My version is inspired by Brent Hilpert with a few differences, notably I put buffers on the data bus (not sure my implementation is valid). Beware the component types are a bit inhomogeneous (mix of TTL LS, ACT, etc...) as I am a Kicad noob!

Later I probably will take inspiration of the work of Peter Schranz:
