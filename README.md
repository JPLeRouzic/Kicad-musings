# PDP-11 hack
This is a folder where are stored various Kicad projects loosely related to PDP-11.

The first project is a (tentative) Kicad schematics the famous PDP-11 hack. It was a project by Len Bayles to build a minimal PDP-11 around the J-11, a PDP-11 microprocessor, on a breadboard.

Several people have since produced various versions of this PDP-11 hack. Each has some additional features.
My version is inspired by Brent Hilpert with a few differences, notably I put buffers on the data bus (not sure my implementation is valid).

Later I probably will take inspiration of the work of Peter Schranz:

# Kim 65C816
This is a tentative to use the 16 bits version of the famous 6502 microprocessor in a sort of KIM board.
Needless to say, I reused the famous work of Eduardo Casino
